    <h1>RAG Information Retrieval</h1>

    <p>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a powerful tool that can retrieve information from weblinks and integrate it into its responses. Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>**Document Processing:** The RAG analyzes the provided document to understand its context, keywords, and the information needed.</li>
        <li>**Link Identification:** It identifies any weblinks within the document.</li>
        <li>**Retrieval:** The RAG fetches relevant information from the identified weblinks using techniques like web scraping or API calls.</li>
        <li>**Integration:** The retrieved information is integrated into the RAG's knowledge base or used directly to generate a response.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>However, there are some limitations to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>**Access Restrictions:** If the weblink requires authentication, the RAG might not be able to access it unless provided with the necessary credentials.</li>
        <li>**Data Quality:** The reliability and accuracy of the retrieved information depend on the source website.</li>
        <li>**Contextual Understanding:** The RAG needs to understand the context of the original document and the weblink to ensure that the retrieved information is relevant and coherent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, RAG can be a valuable tool for fetching and incorporating information from external sources. It's important to consider the potential limitations and ensure that the retrieved data is reliable and relevant to the task at hand.</p>
