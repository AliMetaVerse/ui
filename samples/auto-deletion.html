                <p>Personal data refers to any information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. This includes obvious details such as a person's name, address, phone number, or email, as well as less apparent identifiers like IP addresses, device IDs, and online browsing behavior. Personal data is protected under various laws and regulations worldwide, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which emphasizes the importance of consent, transparency, and accountability in data handling.

                    The proper management of personal data is crucial for ensuring privacy and security in today's digital age. Organizations collecting and processing personal information must implement robust safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or breaches. Individuals also play a role in protecting their personal data by being mindful of the information they share online and the permissions they grant to applications and services. As technology continues to evolve, the need for responsible data management practices becomes increasingly vital.</p>
